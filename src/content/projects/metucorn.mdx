## Overview

metucorn is a movie watching and physical ticket platform designed to bring the shared viewing experience online and physical 
cinemas at the same time. "New generational media but not controlled by the five major families :D (!)" It allows users to browse an 
extensive movie catalog, purchase tickets, and host synchronized watch parties with friends. The platform solves the challenge 
of remote movie nights by ensuring that everyone in the party sees the exact same frame at the same time, managed by the host.
