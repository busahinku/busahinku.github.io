This post demonstrates all the enhanced blog features. Use the **text arrangement toggle** in the header to customize your reading experience with different fonts, text sizes, line heights, and content widths.

## Callout Cards

Use callout cards to highlight important information, warnings, tips, and more.

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
  This is an informational callout. Use it to provide additional context or details that readers might find helpful.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate faster! Press `Ctrl + K` to open the command palette.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when modifying configuration files. Always backup your data before making changes.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger" title="Critical">
  Never share your API keys or passwords in public repositories. This can lead to security breaches.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Well Done!">
  You've successfully completed the setup process. Your application is now ready to use.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note">
  This feature is available in version 2.0 and above. Check your version before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Mathematical Equations with KaTeX

One of the most powerful features is full LaTeX math support<Cite id="knuth" num={1} />. You can write inline math like $E = mc^2$ or the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ directly in your text.

For more complex equations, use display mode:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

Here's the famous Euler's identity:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

And a matrix example:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Calculus Example

The derivative of a function using the limit definition:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

## Interactive Concept Checks

Test your understanding with interactive questions. Click on the answer area to reveal the solution!

<ConceptCheck question="What is the time complexity of binary search?">
  **O(log n)** - The search space is halved with each iteration, leading to logarithmic time complexity<Cite id="cormen" num={2} />. For an array of 1 million elements, binary search needs at most 20 comparisons.
</ConceptCheck>

<ConceptCheck question="What does the Big O notation O(n) mean?">
  **Linear time complexity** - The algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size. If you double the input, the time roughly doubles as well.
</ConceptCheck>

<ConceptCheck>
  <span slot="question">In the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, what is the discriminant?</span>
  The discriminant is $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. It determines the nature of the roots:
  - If $\Delta > 0$: Two distinct real roots
  - If $\Delta = 0$: One repeated real root
  - If $\Delta < 0$: Two complex conjugate roots
</ConceptCheck>

## Video Embeds

Easily embed YouTube and Vimeo videos with privacy-enhanced URLs:

### YouTube Video

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Sample YouTube Video" />

### Vimeo Video

<VideoEmbed url="https://vimeo.com/148751763" title="Sample Vimeo Video" />

## Single Image

You can also display a single image with a caption:

<figure>
  <Image src={img2} alt="A beautiful mountain landscape" width={720} />
  <figcaption>A beautiful mountain landscape during sunset</figcaption>
</figure>

## Photo Gallery

Display images in a beautiful grid with lightbox support. Click any image to view it in fullscreen!

### Three Column Gallery

<PhotoGallery
  columns={3}
  images={[
    { src: img1, alt: "Placeholder image 1", caption: "Beautiful landscape view" },
    { src: img2, alt: "Placeholder image 2", caption: "Mountain scenery" },
    { src: img3, alt: "Placeholder image 3", caption: "Ocean sunset" },
  ]}
/>

### Two Column Gallery

<PhotoGallery
  columns={2}
  images={[
    { src: img4, alt: "Placeholder image 4", caption: "Forest path" },
    { src: img1, alt: "Placeholder image 1", caption: "Another view" },
  ]}
/>

## Typography and Text Formatting

The enhanced blog layout includes improved typography with proper heading hierarchy and spacing.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

### Blockquotes

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
>
> — Steve Jobs

### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item with some additional text to show wrapping
- Second item
- Third item with **bold** and *italic* text

Ordered list:
1. First step in the process
2. Second step with more details
3. Third step to complete the task

## Table of Contents

Notice the floating table of contents on the left side (on desktop). It highlights the current section as you scroll and allows quick navigation to any heading.

On mobile devices, you'll find a collapsible TOC dropdown at the top of the article.

## Reading Preferences

Click the text icon (Aa) in the header to customize:

- **Font**: Switch between Sans-serif and Serif fonts
- **Line Height**: Choose Compact, Normal, or Relaxed spacing
- **Width**: Select Narrow, Normal, or Wide content width

Your preferences are saved and will persist across sessions!

## Conclusion

This enhanced blog layout provides a modern, feature-rich reading experience with:

- Full KaTeX/LaTeX math support
- Interactive concept check components
- Video embeds for YouTube and Vimeo
- Photo galleries with lightbox
- Floating table of contents
- Customizable text arrangement
- Improved typography and spacing

All features work seamlessly across light, dark, and paper themes.
