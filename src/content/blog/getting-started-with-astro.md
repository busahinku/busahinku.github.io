Astro is a modern web framework that allows you to build fast, content-focused websites. It's perfect for blogs, marketing sites, and documentation.

## Why Astro?

Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, making your sites incredibly fast. You can use your favorite UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.

## Getting Started

First, create a new Astro project using the CLI. Then customize your configuration and start building.
